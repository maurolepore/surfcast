# surfcast

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The surfcast package and [app](https://maurolepore.shinyapps.io/surfcast/) make
it easy to find the best place to surf during a given season or month. The data
comes from https://www.surf-forecast.com/.

## Installation

You can install the development version of surfcast with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("maurolepore/surfcast")
```

## Example

Use the database [online](https://maurolepore.shinyapps.io/surfcast/). You may
also access the data via a shiny app or directly in R.

```{r example}
library(surfcast)
library(tibble)

if (interactive()) run_app()

unique(best_conditions$country)

best_conditions
```
